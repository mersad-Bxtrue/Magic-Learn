# Magic-Learn
This is my first responsive project with HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript In this educational project, I tried to implement my learning in the best way and the focus was on the main page.
In this project, I tried to limit myself to how much I can use CSS tricks instead of JavaScript.

It is interesting to know that for this project, I have created my own style grid system and responsive design to challenge my responsive design skills without the need for flexbox or cssgrid or any framework.üòç
